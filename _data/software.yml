- name: rentrez
  description: rentrez is an R package for the NCBI EUtils api. Usig this API, 
      rentrez allows users search for,  find cross-references among and download 
      records from each of NCBI's databases (including GenBank, Pubmed and dbSNP).
      rentrez is part of the <a href="ropensci.org">ROpenSci</i> project, and the 
      source repository provides extensive documentation for the package.

- name: accuMUlate
  description: accuMUlate is a c++ program for indentifying <i>de novo</i>
     mutations from NGS data generated from mutation accumulation (MA) experiments. 
     In contrast to existing heurestic methods of mutation detection, accuMUlate takes a 
     probablistic approach to calling mutations, building a model that matches the 
     design of MA experiments.

      <a href="http://opentreeoflife.org/">Open Tree of Life database</a>. This package was developed as part of 
      a NESCent hackathon, with <a href="http://francoismichonneau.net/">François Michonneau</a>,
      <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~josephwb/">Joseph Brown</a> and I

- name: mmod
  description: Population geneticists have traditionally used as statisti called 
      Nei's Gst to measure  divergence between populations. However, it has 
      become clear that Gst does not have a simple relationship to divergene, 
      especially for very highly polymorphic loci. 
      <br><br> 
      <a href="http://www.molecularecologist.com/2011/03/should-i-use-fst-gst-or-d-2/">
      A number of new statistics have been developed to account for this problem</a>,  
      mmod is a package that brings three of these measures; Hedricks (2005, 2011) G''st 
      Jost's (2008) D and Meirman's (2005) φ'st to R, along with a function that 
     calculates Nei's Gst using nearly unbiased estimators for Hs and Ht  (the two 
     key parameters from which most of these stats are calculated). All these 
     functions work on `genind` objects from the package `adegenet` so data can be 
     read in from standard `genepop` for `fstat` files
